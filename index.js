Using Prepared Statements
With MySQL2 you also get the prepared statements. With prepared statements MySQL doesn't have to prepare plan for same query everytime, this results in better performance. If you don't know why they are important, please check these discussions

How prepared statements can protect from SQL Injection attacks
MySQL provides execute helper which will prepare and query the statement. You can also manually prepare / unprepare statement with prepare / unprepare methods.

// get the client
const mysql = require('mysql2');

// create the connection to database
const connection = mysql.createConnection({
  host: 'localhost',
  user: 'root',
  database: 'test'
});

// execute will internally call prepare and query
connection.execute(
  'SELECT * FROM `table` WHERE `name` = ? AND `age` > ?',
  ['Rick C-137', 53],
  function(err, results, fields) {
    console.log(results); // results contains rows returned by server
    console.log(fields); // fields contains extra meta data about results, if available

    // If you execute same statement again, it will be picked from a LRU cache
    // which will save query preparation time and give better performance
  }
); */

   

// add an employee - CREATE



// update an employee
